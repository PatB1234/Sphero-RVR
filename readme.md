## Sphero RVR Obstacle completer
This was made for the Future Learning summit 2025 hosted by St. Christopher's School of Bahrain. Me and my team made this program to introduce many to programming in a metacognitive way. The objective is to complete an obstacle course by using different colourd tiles where each tile has a different function. They have to figure out each function. A competitive aspect is introduced as the players compete to complete the course the fastest & with the least collions.

- Green - Turn Right 
- Red/Orange - Turn Left
